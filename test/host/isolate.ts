// Imported first, before anything loads OpenCode. OpenCode derives its global paths from the environment, and under
// Bun os.homedir() ignores a changed HOME, so the whole environment is replaced: HOME, OPENCODE_TEST_HOME, XDG_* and
// TMPDIR point into a fresh temp root, nothing else is inherited (no parent OpenCode, provider key or proxy), and the
// working directory moves there too, because the host also opens a location at it. The root is a git repository under
// the system's /tmp, never under TMPDIR or HOME: OpenCode looks for `.opencode` folders and project config upwards
// from a location, and stops at the repository's root, so it never finds the agents or skills of whoever runs the test.
