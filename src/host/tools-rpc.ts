/**
 * The tools RPC: a plugin's known read tools as RPC methods, so a script can call them with no model.
 *
 *   POST /api/rpc/<plugin id>.tools/<method>
 *   { "input": { "sessionID": "<session>", "input": <the tool's input> } }
 *
 * A script runs as a session and the agent it names, with exactly the access that agent's model would have:
 * - a tool the agent's or the session's rules hide from the model (the last rule for the tool on `*` is a deny)
 *   is refused with PERMISSION_DENIED before it runs;
 * - an MCP tool runs through OpenCode's own executor from `ctx.tool.list()`, which checks `<server>_<tool>` against
 *   the agent's rules, the session's rules and saved approvals, and sends OpenCode's own credential;
 * - a plugin-owned tool runs its own spec, with its own `ctx.permission.assert` calls;
 * - an `ask` is refused at once, because no one is there to answer it: an `evaluate` hook turns it into a deny, only
 *   for this RPC's own calls in flight (their source ids), so no other call is touched;
 * - a deny names the refused action, the method's own or an inner one, and says to change the rule: a rule deny never
 *   reaches `evaluate` hooks, so its action comes from OpenCode's own `Permission denied: <action>` text.
 * Only known reads become methods. Writes, sends, unknown tools and local-file exports never do.
 *
 * The executor bypasses `execute.before` and `execute.after` hooks, so `shapeResult` applies here whatever those
 * hooks do on the model path.
 *
 * Shared module. Each plugin keeps its own copy, because each bundle is self-contained. Edit only the block between
 * the PLUGIN-SPECIFIC markers. Everything else is identical in every plugin: the plugin's `check-copies.mjs` fails
 * its check when it is not, so change it in every plugin at once.
